# **PROJECT SUMMARY:**

This **Selenium WebDriver** automation script performs a series of actions on the **Demoblaze** online store to:

* Log in using predefined credentials.
* Navigate through product categories.
* Add a product to the cart.
* Handle browser alerts.
* Verify the success of the login and the active session.

## **KEY POINTS:**

### **Setup:**

* **Selenium WebDriver** is used for browser automation.
* **WebDriverManager** is utilized to manage and automatically set up **ChromeDriver**.

### **Login Automation:**

* Logs in with the username **“Learn”** and password **“learn123”**.
* Verifies login by checking for the welcome message: **"Welcome Learn"**.

### **Navigation & Interaction:**

* Clicks on a product category and adds an item to the cart.
* Scrolls the page to ensure that all required elements are visible for interaction.

### **Alert Handling:**

* Accepts a pop-up alert after adding a product to the cart.

### **Verification:**

* Verifies successful login by checking the welcome username on the page.

## **TECHNOLOGIES USED:**

* **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation.
* **TestNG** for managing and executing the test.
* **WebDriverManager** for handling the ChromeDriver setup.

---

## **TEST EXECUTION:**

* The script is executed using **TestNG**.
* **WebDriverManager** handles ChromeDriver version compatibility automatically.

## **EXTENDED PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY OVERVIEW:**

This project demonstrates website automation with **Selenium WebDriver** combined with **TestNG** for a demo e-commerce site (**Demoblaze**). It includes automating the login process, navigating product categories, adding items to the cart, and confirming successful login and session verification.

### **References and Additional Details:**

#### 1. **WebDriverManager Integration:**

* **WebDriverManager** simplifies the process of managing browser drivers, ensuring automatic downloading of the correct version.
* **[WebDriverManager GitHub](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager)**
* **Key Point**: Automatically sets up the correct version of ChromeDriver.

#### 2. **ChromeDriver Setup:**

* **ChromeDriver** is used to interact with the Chrome browser during automated tasks.
* **[Selenium WebDriver Docs on ChromeDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/)**
* **Key Point**: Enables WebDriver to control the Chrome browser.

#### 3. **Maximizing Browser Window:**

* The browser window is maximized to ensure elements are visible.
* **[Selenium WebDriver Documentation: Window Management](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/browser/window/)**
* **Key Point**: Avoids issues with elements being out of view.

#### 4. **Implicit Wait:**

* The WebDriver waits for a specified time for elements to load before throwing an exception.
* **[Selenium Implicit Wait Documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/waits/#implicit-wait)**
* **Key Point**: Ensures elements load before interacting with them.

#### 5. **Navigating to the Webpage:**

* Opens the **Demoblaze** homepage with `driver.get()`.
* **[Selenium WebDriver Documentation: Navigation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/browser/navigation/)**
* **Key Point**: Basic method for navigating to a URL.

#### 6. **Logging In:**

* Automates the login process by entering credentials and clicking the login button.
* **[Selenium WebDriver Form Handling](https://www.guru99.com/handling-login-page-in-selenium-webdriver.html)**
* **Key Point**: Mimics user behavior for logging in.

#### 7. **Explicit Wait (Advanced Waiting Mechanism):**

* Uses **WebDriverWait** to wait for elements to be visible or clickable.
* **[Selenium Explicit Wait Documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/waits/#explicit-wait)**
* **Key Point**: More efficient for waiting for specific conditions.

#### 8. **Scrolling into View (JavaScript Execution):**

* Scrolls the page to bring elements into view using JavaScript.
* **[Selenium WebDriver JavaScript Executor](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/actions_interactions/#executing-javascript)**
* **Key Point**: Simulates browser-level actions like scrolling.

#### 9. **Selecting and Adding Products to Cart:**

* Interacts with product elements to select and add them to the shopping cart.
* **[Handling Links, Buttons, and Forms with Selenium WebDriver](https://www.guru99.com/handling-forms-in-selenium-webdriver.html)**
* **Key Point**: Automates product selection and cart addition.

#### 10. **Handling Alerts:**

* Handles browser alerts after adding products to the cart.
* **[Selenium WebDriver Handling Alerts](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/interactions/alerts/)**
* **Key Point**: Interacts with pop-up alerts (confirmation boxes, warnings).

#### 11. **Verifying the Login:**

* Uses assertions to verify successful login based on the displayed username.
* **[TestNG Assertion Methods](https://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#assertions)**
* **Key Point**: Validates test results and ensures correct behavior.

#### 12. **Closing the Browser:**

* Closes the browser after the test completes.
* **[Selenium WebDriver Documentation: Closing the Browser](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/browser/window/#closing-windows)**
* **Key Point**: Releases resources and ends the session.
